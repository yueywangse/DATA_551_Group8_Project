# Team Contract – DATA 551 Dashboard Project

## Goals
### 1. Team Overall Goals
Our team goals are:

- To complete a Dashboard project that meets the course requirements on time.

- To design an application with a clear structure, logical reasoning, and user-friendly interface.

- To achieve high quality standards in data analysis, visualization, and teamwork.

We hope that the final product not only meets the assignment requirements but also possesses a certain level of professionalism and completeness.

### 2. Individual Goals

In this project, each member hopes to:

- Improve data visualization and dashboard design skills

- Learn more standardized team collaboration and GitHub workflows

- Improve communication and project management skills

Furthermore, they hope to accumulate more mature team experience through collaboration.

### 3. Potential Challenges

We may face the following challenges:

- Heavy course load leading to time conflicts

- Different work paces among team members

- Technical difficulty exceeding expectations (such as deployment or interaction implementation issues)

- Different opinions on design direction or quality standards

We will mitigate these risks through advance planning, timely communication, and reasonable division of labor.

### 4. Handling Inconsistent Performance Goals

If the team's overall goal is to achieve an A, but individual members prefer a B due to time constraints or personal scheduling issues, we will:

- Openly discuss time commitment and quality standards

- Adjust project complexity while ensuring fairness

- Use team consensus as the final standard

No member may unilaterally lower the team's overall standards.

### 5. Regarding whether some members should be allowed to take on more work:

We believe that:

- Work allocation should be as fair as possible.

- Core work should not be consistently handled by a few members.

In special circumstances (for example, a member has more free time or volunteers for extra tasks), more work can be assigned with team approval, but:

- This should not become the default arrangement.

- It should not create a long-term imbalance.

- It must be accurately reflected in the contribution document.

## Meeting Norms
### 1. Meeting Frequency and Format
- The team will hold 1-2 regular meetings per week.

- The frequency of meetings may be increased as milestones or deadlines approach.

- Meetings will primarily be online (e.g., Zoom), but offline meetings may be held if possible.

Meeting times will be determined based on the schedules of most members; any adjustments should be communicated in advance.

### 2. Meeting Duration and Efficiency

- Regular meetings will be kept within 45-60 minutes.

- Meetings should start and end on time.

- Discussions should focus on project progress and problem-solving, avoiding irrelevant digressions.

If discussions run too long, some content can be transferred to online follow-up communication.

3. Meeting Structure

Each meeting will include the following:

- Brief progress reports from each member

- Current problems or technical difficulties

- Assignment of tasks for the next phase

- Confirmation of deadlines

Each member should complete basic preparation before the meeting to avoid discussing unresolved issues.

### 4. Meeting Agenda and Minutes

- A brief agenda will be prepared before each meeting. Meeting minutes are taken on a rotating basis by each member.

- Meeting minutes must include:

  - Key decisions

  - Task assignments

  - Deadlines

  - Unresolved issues

Meeting minutes will be stored in a shared document or project repository.

### 5. Absence and Lateness Rules

- If unable to attend a meeting, please provide at least 24 hours' notice.

- Absence or lateness without a valid reason will negatively impact team collaboration.

- Absent members are responsible for reviewing the meeting minutes and following up on task assignments.

## Work Norms
### 1. Time Investment and Work Pace

Each member is expected to dedicate approximately 6–8 hours per week to project-related tasks.

Team members should:

- Manage their time effectively, avoiding concentrating all tasks before the deadline.

- Start key parts of the work early.

- In case of time conflicts, explain promptly.

We encourage completing tasks ahead of schedule, rather than relying on last-minute rushes.

### 2. Task Assignment and Recording

- Tasks will be discussed and assigned in meetings.

- All tasks must have a clearly defined responsible party and deadline.

- Task assignments will be recorded in GitHub Issues or shared documents.

Task assignment should be as fair as possible, avoiding long-term assignment of core work by the same member.

### 3. Deadline Setting

- Each task must have a clearly defined deadline.

- Internal deadlines should be earlier than the final course deadline.

- If unable to complete on time, explain in advance and seek adjustments.

Untimely delays or unjustified delays will affect the overall progress.

### 4. Work Quality and Review

Team members should:

- Submit complete, functional, and clearly structured deliverables

- Maintain code style and readability

- Conduct a basic self-check before merging

Important modifications should be briefly reviewed via Pull Request before merging.

If there are disagreements regarding work quality, consensus should be reached through discussion, not unilateral modifications.

### 5. Handling of Failure to Fulfill Responsibilities

In the following situations:

- Failure to complete assigned tasks

- Multiple missed internal deadlines

- Lack of response to team messages for an extended period

The team will:

1. Communicate privately to understand the reasons

2. Coordinate tasks or reassign work

3. Record persistent issues

4. If the issue is serious and persistent, consider consulting the instructor or TA

We prioritize resolving issues, not blaming individuals.

### 6. Coordinating Different Work Habits

Team members may have different work habits:

- Some prefer to finish early

- Some prefer to finish all at once before the deadline

We will reduce conflicts caused by differences in work pace by clearly defining internal deadlines and phased goals.

## Decision Making
### 1. General Decisions

For routine decisions (e.g., task assignments, meeting times, periodic adjustments), the team can reach a consensus through simple discussions.

If no significant objections are raised after the discussion, the decision is considered approved.

### 2. Major Decisions

For major decisions affecting the overall direction,

- Dashboard structure adjustments

- Changes in visualization design direction

- Technology solution selection

- Deployment method determination

decisions should be made after thorough discussion.

We prioritize consensus-based decisions.

If complete consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote will be used to decide.

### 3. Handling Disagreements

When team members have differing opinions on an issue:

- Encourage them to provide reasons and evidence to support their viewpoints.

- Avoid emotional expressions.

- Prioritize the overall quality of the project.

If a member insists on a particular idea, the team will:

- Assess its feasibility and risks.

- Discuss whether a small-scale trial is feasible.

- Make a decision within a reasonable timeframe.

### 4. Decision Recording

All important decisions should be recorded in meeting minutes, including:

- Decision content

- Participating members

- Conclusion

To avoid misunderstandings or repeated discussions later.

## Accountability and Conflict Resolution
### 1. Individual Responsibilities

Each team member is responsible for the following:

- Completing assigned tasks on time

- Proactively reporting progress

- Responding promptly to team communications

- Ensuring basic quality of submitted work

Teamwork is built on trust and a sense of responsibility.

### 2. Failure to Fulfill Responsibilities

In the following situations:

- Failure to complete tasks on time

- Multiple absences from meetings

- Long periods without responding to messages

- Significantly substandard work quality

The team will handle the situation according to the following steps:

- Communicate privately to understand the reasons

- Coordinate and adjust tasks or schedules

- If the problem persists, record the relevant information

- Seek advice from the instructor or TA if necessary

We prioritize problem-solving, not blame-making.

### 3. Conflict Resolution

When disagreements or misunderstandings arise within the team:

- First, resolve through rational discussion

- Focus on the problem itself, not individuals

- Respect different viewpoints

If the conflict cannot be resolved internally, seek assistance from the course instructor or TA.

### 4. Amending this Agreement

This team agreement can only be amended with the consent of all members.
